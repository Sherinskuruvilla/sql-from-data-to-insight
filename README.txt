Google Play Store Apps Data was a mini project that me and 3 other colleagues had to complete during our third week of the  bootcamp. 

We took the dataset from Kaggle which is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/munazairshad/google-play-store-apps-data?select=google_play_store.csv

We did the data cleaning using pandas functions such as regex,.replace. Then we export it as a CSV and import it into MySQL workbench.

In order to analyse the data we used sql queries with GROUP BY,ORDER BY,CASE,AVG(),SUM(),COUNT(),STD,WINDOW FUNCTIONS,Subqueries etc.
With the results from the queries we have created some visualizations also.

Afterwards, as part of the miniproject, we created a presentation in which we shared the step that we took to finish it and the results. The presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14cBVueuqRwd9VjoLgxH0pGszJmZPalcwJn5nT62c9GA/edit?slide=id.g33d6d21602f_2_0#slide=id.g33d6d21602f_2_0
